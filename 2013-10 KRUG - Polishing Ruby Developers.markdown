# Idea
> This is one of many approaches. None of them is “right”. This one is mine - and hopefully others in the audience.
> However note that there is at least one person in the audience who actually wants to work with developers the way I show here.

# Work VS Position
> You no longer search for position. Instead you are your own employer. You only look for partners that have work to do. You do this work and everyone benefit. No more organizational bullshit - you are an adult and you can take care of yourself.

# Traits of Polished Ruby Programmer

# Planning Ahead
## Multi-step Solutions
